  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 22 November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Nightfall Studios</strong> ("Nightfall Studios", "we", "us", "our")
    collects, uses, stores, and shares information when you use our websites, user accounts, forums, Discord bots,
    and any related products or services (collectively, the "Services").

  <p>
    For Discord bots, this may include "basically everything you do in a server" that the bot is configured to log or respond to,
    depending on server settings and features enabled by the server owner.

    <li>timestamps and basic diagnostic logs.</li>

    We use cookies and similar technologies on our website to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>keep you logged in,</li>
    <li>remember preferences,</li>
    <li>provide basic analytics and security functions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party cross-site tracking cookies from other sites for advertising.
  </p>

  <h3>3.5 Linked Third-Party Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to link third-party accounts (for example: Discord, GitHub, TikTok, X (Twitter), Instagram),
    we may receive basic profile information from those services, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>user ID and username or handle,</li>
    <li>avatar or profile image URL,</li>
    <li>other profile fields those platforms expose and you authorize.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to create and manage your Nightfall account,</li>
    <li>to operate and secure the website, forums, dashboards, and bots,</li>
    <li>to provide and improve both free and premium features, including Nightfall+ tiers,</li>
    <li>to handle authentication, rate limiting, and abuse prevention,</li>
    <li>to provide moderation and logging tools where enabled by server owners,</li>
    <li>to personalize aspects of the Services (such as cosmetic and customization features),</li>
    <li>to communicate with you about updates, changes, incidents, and support issues,</li>
    <li>to comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal Bases (Where Applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, our processing of your personal data may be based on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>your consent (for example, when you link third-party accounts or enable optional features),</li>
    <li>performance of a contract (for example, providing an account and Services you sign up for),</li>
    <li>our legitimate interests (for example, securing the Services and preventing abuse),</li>
    <li>compliance with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for legitimate and lawful purposes, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>for the life of your Nightfall account,</li>
    <li>as required to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes,</li>
    <li>for security and abuse-prevention logs for a reasonable period.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Moderation logs and similar temporary logs within servers may be stored only while such logging is enabled
    and may be cleared after a specified time or when a server owner or moderator deletes them using the dashboard
    or in-server tools.
  </p>

  <h2>7. How Server Owners Control Data</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a Discord server owner or administrator:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>you may configure which modules, logging features, and moderation tools are enabled,</li>
    <li>you may clear or delete logs related to your server through the dashboard or provided commands, where available,</li>
    <li>you may request that Nightfall Studios remove server-specific data, subject to verification.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    We may share your information with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>service providers who host, store, or process data on our behalf,</li>
    <li>third-party platforms you choose to link (for example, Discord, GitHub, TikTok, X (Twitter), Instagram),</li>
    <li>analytics, security, or infrastructure providers,</li>
    <li>law enforcement or other authorities where required by applicable law or valid legal process.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because our Services are available globally, your information may be transferred to and processed in countries
    other than your own. Where required, we take reasonable steps to ensure appropriate protections are in place.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have some or all of the following rights:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to access the personal data we hold about you,</li>
    <li>to correct inaccurate or incomplete data,</li>
    <li>to request deletion of your data,</li>
    <li>to object to or restrict certain types of processing,</li>
    <li>to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent,</li>
    <li>to obtain a copy of your data in a portable format, where technically feasible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can exercise many of these rights directly through your Nightfall dashboard (for example, by deleting your account
    and associated data) or by contacting us at
    <a href="mailto:legal@nightfallstudios.ca">legal@nightfallstudios.ca</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You can generally:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>delete your Nightfall account and associated data through the dashboard, and</li>
    <li>ask your Discord server owner or administrator to clear server-specific logs and data where our tools allow it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you need a broader or more specific deletion (for example, Discord data across multiple servers), you can contact us at
    <a href="mailto:legal@nightfallstudios.ca">legal@nightfallstudios.ca</a>. We may need to verify your identity before processing the request.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against loss, theft, misuse,
    unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, no system is perfectly secure. You are responsible for protecting your account credentials and taking
    appropriate care on your own devices and networks.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Children and Minimum Age</h2>
  <p>
    The Services are intended for users who are at least <strong>16 years old</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 16. If we become aware that we have collected
    personal data from a user under 16, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
  </p>
  <p>
    If changes are material, we may provide additional notice (for example, via the website, dashboard, or Discord announcements).
    Your continued use of the Services after the updated Privacy Policy becomes effective means you accept the changes.
  </p>
